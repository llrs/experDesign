\title{experDesign: Expert experiment design in batches}
\description{
Enables easy distribution of samples per batch avoiding batch and
confounding effects by randomization of the variables in each batch.
}
\details{
The most important function is \code{\link[=design]{design()}}, which distributes
samples in batches according to the information provided.

To help in the bench there is the \code{\link[=inspect]{inspect()}} function that appends
the group to the data provided.

If you have a grid or some spatial data, you might want to look at the
\code{\link[=spatial]{spatial()}} function to distribute the samples while keeping the original
design.

In case an experiment was half processed and you need to extend it you can
use \code{\link[=follow_up]{follow_up()}} or \code{\link[=follow_up2]{follow_up2()}}. It helps selecting which samples
already used should be used in the follow up.
